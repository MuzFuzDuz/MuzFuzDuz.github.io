            <p1>Let me start off by saying, bass fishing is a great pastime for anyone to get into. You can learn a lot of life’s lessons out on the water like patience, a good work ethic, the value of investment, teamwork and so much more. And it’s just really fun! But bass fishing can be pretty tough at times, especially for an angler just starting out. So today, we hope to simplify some of those first few trips for you and help put a few fish in your hands. Because we know, even a little success early on is often all you need to stick with it.</p1>
            <h1>When to go Fishing</h1>
            <p2>There are specific days and times of the day when bass feed better. Now I’m not suggesting it’s as specific as ‘they bite best every Tuesday and Thursday’. We’re not talking fixed days on the calendar, but instead days when several variables lineup. That being said, bass do have certain feeding windows that hold true almost everyday. For instance, bass feed really well the first 30 minutes of daylight and the last 30 minutes of daylight, and that holds true winter, spring, summer and fall.</p2>
            <h2>Where to go</h2>
            <p3>Knowing where to look is also extremely important, but should not be intimidating. First and foremost, bass love cover. These fish are predators which have to hunt for their food. They have two options: they can swim around and chase bait, suspending at times out in the open water or they can find a piece of cover, settle in and prepare to ambush the first thing that comes by. One method requires a lot more energy than the other, and you’ll find more often than not there are some fish relating to some cover all the time no matter what fishery you are on.</p3>
