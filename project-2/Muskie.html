                <p>It’s a fact that you can’t expect to catch muskies in great numbers, or even each time you go fishing. Yet those who know how to catch muskies score pretty well, with fall muskie fishing being especially productive. Successful muskie fishing requires discipline, dedication, patience, and a lot of hours on the water. This primer on muskie fishing for beginners will help you get started. Muskie's being predatory fish means that they will go after any other fish they can eat. Also muskie being very territorial fish means that they don't coexist with other muskie very well making populations not grow as fast as the other fish around them.</p>
                <h2>What Muskies Eat</h2>
                <p>Muskies are an apex predator and eat a lot of different fish, many of which are fairly large in size. Among their top foods are yellow perch, suckers, golden shiners, and walleyes, with smallmouth bass and many other fish on their menu.</p>
                <h2>Good Baits</h2>
                <p>Popular muskie lures include large jigs, jerkbaits, surface plugs, bucktail spinners, and some diving plugs. Bucktails and jerkbaits are especially favored for casting, as well as large topwater lures. These are particularly good over the top of submerged cover, and along the edges of shallow submerged cover. Black is the top producer.</p>
