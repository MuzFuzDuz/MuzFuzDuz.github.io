        </div>

        <div id="body">
            <p1>Catfish are one of the most popular fish in the U.S. for several reasons. For one, they are found in nearly every state, giving anglers plenty of opportunities to learn how to fish for “cats.” Some of the 49 species found in North America can easily reach double digit weights, they are almost always hungry, and most can make a drag on a fishing reel sing. The potential fillets are a delectable bonus.

                Because they are exclusively freshwater fish, you can only learn how to catch catfish in rivers, ponds and lakes. Check out the following catfish fishing tips to maximize your chances of landing these delicious fish.</p1>
            <h1>Different catfish Rigs:</h1>
            <h2>Drift Rig:</h2>
            <p2>For better bait placement and casting distance, consider using a drift rig. Simply pinch 1 to 2 lead shots (depending on the strength of the current) on the line 6 to 12 inches above the hook baited with fresh cutbait. This rig also is also preferred for drifting across shallow flats in lakes, ponds, or reservoirs.</p2>
            <h3>Slipfloat Rig:</h3>
            <p3>For better bait placement and casting distance, consider using a drift rig. Simply pinch 1 to 2 lead shots (depending on the strength of the current) on the line 6 to 12 inches above the hook baited with fresh cutbait. This rig also is also preferred for drifting across shallow flats in lakes, ponds, or reservoirs.</p3>
            <h4>Slip Rig:</h4>
            <p4>The egg sinker slip rig is, hands down, the most popular rig for still fishing catfish. Consisting of an egg sinker on the main line held in place above the hook by a lead shot, this rig is ideal for keeping the bait near the bottom, which in turn, allows a catfish to swim off with the bait with little tension. Unfortunately, despite the popularity of this rig, it may not always be the most effective. This is mainly due to the egg sinker itself which has a tendency to snag as it rolls along the bottom when cast across current.</p4>
            <h5>Poly-Ball Rig:</h5>
            <p5>Also called the English poly ball rig, this setup keeps your bait anchored in place, but off the bottom. This is an especially effective technique for anglers using live bait that need to maintain the appearance of swimming. It’s also a good method for keeping dead bait and lures suspended above bottom debris. Follow the instructions for creating the slipfloat rig and add a 1- to 2-inch styrofoam (poly) ball on the leader.</p5>
            <h6>Three-Way Rig:</h6>
            <p6>The three-way (or Wolf River rig) is an ideal rig for slipdrifting on big rivers like the Mississippi, Colorado or Missouri and for drifting wind-blown flats in large reservoirs like Santee Cooper. The three-way rig consists of a 2- to 3-feet leader and a 6- to 24-inch dropline anchored by a bell sinker. While a half-ounce sinker may be enough for still water, one up to 8 ounces may be needed to drift around the tips of dams for blue and channel cats.</p6>
